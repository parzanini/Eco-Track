                  Recycling plays a critical role in reducing waste, conserving
                  natural resources, and lowering pollution. By reusing
                  materials like plastics, metals, paper, and glass, we prevent
                  these items from ending up in landfills and reduce the need
                  for new raw materials. Recycling not only helps the
                  environment but also supports sustainable communities.

                  At EcoTrack, we believe that recycling is essential to
                  safeguarding our planet for future generations. That's why our
                  platform is designed to help individuals and organizations
                  take control of their waste habits. Using EcoTrack, you can
                  set waste reduction goals, monitor your progress, and
                  contribute to a cleaner, greener Earth.

                  <li><strong>Conserving Natural Resources:</strong> Recycling reduces the demand for raw materials like trees, water, and minerals, helping preserve our planet's resources for future generations.</li>
                  <li><strong>Energy Savings:</strong> Recycling uses significantly less energy compared to producing new products from raw materials. For example, recycling aluminum saves 95% of the energy required to make the same product from new aluminum.</li>  
                  <li><strong>Waste Reduction:</strong> Recycling helps decrease the amount of waste sent to landfills, reducing pollution and the release of harmful chemicals into the environment.</li>  
                  <li><strong>Climate Change Mitigation:</strong> By reducing the energy required to create new products, recycling lowers greenhouse gas emissions, helping to combat global warming.</li>
